# DIL-GP
The official implementation of **Domain Invariant Learning for Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Exploration**. We propose a domain invariant learning algorithm for Gaussian processes (DIL-GP) with a min-max optimization on the likelihood. DIL-GP discovers the heterogeneity in the data and forces invariance across partitioned subsets of data. 


## How to Run
**easily run code by:**

    # 1D Synthetic Dataset 

    python train_gp_dilgp.py
  
    python train_gp_kernel.py
  
    python train_sklearn.py

**adjust hyperparameters by:**
    
    TBD

 **Result:**
